A simple program to help you solve wordle. Give it your first word (please see best_words.txt) for the codes recommendations, and then give the feedback that wordle gave you (either R (red, or no match), Y (yellow), or G (green)). The program will then suggest the best word to eliminate the most possible guesses while still following all the previous feedback wordle had given. Instead of using that word you can type OPTIONS to get a list of the best words as well as the average number of words that will be eliminated with that guess.
